# Battleship
[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) is a strategy game in which 2 plays take turns guessing the location of other player's ships.
This small program was written for a class I attended over the summer of 2022 and mimics the basic funcitonality of the game. In the future, I hope to add a simple guessing algorithm to the computer so it
attempts to take out ships that it already has located, as opposed to randomly guessing even when there are open ships.
